Based on the suggestions from the participating instructors, this session will cover lessons learned and some FAQs. The goal of the sessions is to provide the opportunity for instructors to have input on lessons learned. The session will be more robust with a group participating together rather than individually. These lessons learned may help bridge the learning curve for those who have only a modest exposure to virtual teaching.
