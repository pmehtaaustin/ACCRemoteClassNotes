Instructors,

If you haven't attended any Basic Blackboard and/or Basic Collaborate sessions, you still have a chance to catch up and view the recordings listed below. The one in red is recommended for Basic Blackboard as the joist productive one.

The last Collaborate session runs tonight at 6:

6-9p: [Basic-Collaborate][basic-collab-3-26-6p]

Starting tomorrow we will have Mentor sessions (one or more mentors will help you work through setting up your classes and Collaborate sessions) as listed below and April 1 Wed we will have a Round table - also listed below.

Based on the suggestions from the participating instructors, this session will be devoted to lessons learned from some FAQ. The goal of the sessions is to provide the opportunity for instructors to have input to lessons learned. The session will be more robust with a group participating together rather than individually. These lessons learned may help bridge the learning curve for those who have only a modest exposure to virtual teaching.
